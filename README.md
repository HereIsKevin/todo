## Why

- **Simple:** Easily add todo items with one click, no unnecessary bloat included.
- **Snappy:** Built with Qt and QML, Todo is GPU-accelerated and native with Electron bloat.
- **Beautiful:** Lovingly crafted UI and made with components based on Material Design.
- **Accessible:** Always available in the menu bar, add todo items at the speed of thought.

## Installation

Download from the [latest binary](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/todo/releases/latest) from releases. Note that on first launch, a dialog similar to this one may pop up.

This is because signing an app requires a certificate, which costs $100 a year. Instead, bypass this dialog by right-clicking on the app in finder, clicking open, and clicking open in the popup to confirm.
